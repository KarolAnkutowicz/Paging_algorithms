# Paging_algorithms

The program enables the execution of paging algorithms on a given or randomly selected database of page calls.

Using algorithms:
- FIFO (First-Input, First-Output);
- LIFO (Last-Input, First-Output);
- LFU (Least Frequently Used);
- MFU (Most Frequently Used).

Additionally:

- draw references;
- read references from file;
- write references to file;
- write algorithms result to file.
